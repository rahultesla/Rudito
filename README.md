# Rudito
This is a turing-complete programming language which needs different approach to code.

## Concept
This language has Three components
* Head 
* Execution
* Tail

### Head
### Execution
Execution is the main component where checking conditions and executing function happens.
It is represented by "[()]".
[function1(condition)function2] is the syntax for this component.
Here function1 is executed if condition returns true else it executes function2.
If a function needs to be executed without checking any condition "()" is not required.
### Tail
Tail is the component which decides location of next code.
It is represented by "||" delimter.
The name of Head component needs to be given inside the delimeter.
By default compiler goes to next line if Tail component is missing. 

## Data Types Supported
